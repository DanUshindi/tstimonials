         <h4> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
           in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every  worth of penny.

         <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I have been looking to make a 
           transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
           for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
           The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
           the course, I have successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          <h4>Such a life-changing experience. 
            Highly recommended!
  
          </h4>
          <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I have never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
           professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
           student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
           did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
           project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
           could ever have. In fact, I have often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
           experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
           100% recommend! ”

         <h4> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
           learning from their experiences was easy.
         </h4>
         <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
           gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
           junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
           a n incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
